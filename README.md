# Crack-Ditection-using-OpenCV
Cracks on the concrete surface are one of the earliest indications of degradation of the structure which is critical for the maintenance as well the continuous exposure will lead to the severe damage to the environment. Manual inspection is the acclaimed method for the crack inspection. In the manual inspection, the sketch of the crack is prepared manually, and the conditions of the irregularities are noted. Since the manual approach completely depends on the specialistâ€™s knowledge and experience, it lacks objectivity in the quantitative analysis. So, automatic image-based crack detection is proposed as a replacement. Literature presents different techniques to automatically identify the crack.
